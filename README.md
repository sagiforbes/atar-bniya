# Project stopped and continue as [banai-ci/banai](https://github.com/banai-ci/banai)

Banai is a single exeutable that runs Banaifile script file. Banaifile script is a Javascript ES5. This means you get all standard libraries from Javascript (ES5) plus objects and functions from banai executor. All the code in the example is a Javascript code written in Banaifile

# Running Banai
If you have a file called Banaifile in your folder, than running:
```
banai
```
Will execute the code in the Banaifile.

If you want to execute a specific banai file, use:
```
banai -f somefile.js
```

By default banai runs the main function inside the banai file. You can change that by naming a function in banaifile. 
For example. At `examples/Banaifile.js` we have a method called: `printOut` To call it directly from cli use:
```
banai -f examples/Banaifile.js printOut
```

You can see more example in banai at: `examples/Banaifile.js`


You can set secrets to the banai by the `-s ` flag, for example:
```
  banai -s examples/secret-file.json
```
For more information look at: [Working with secret configuration](#Secrets-configuration)

## Http client
You can easly make http client request to a server. You can pass the url to the site, custome headers and cookies. If an error occurs an exception is thrown. 

You can pass options (not mandatory) to each request. Options field is:
``` javascript
{
  ignoreHttpsChecks: false, //Set to true (default) if you want to ignore checks on the https certificate. If set to false, client will fail on self signed certificate
  allowRedirect: false, //Follow redirect return from the server. Setting this field to false will not allow redirect (default is true).
  timeout: 10, // Send to complete the request. Set to zero (default) to never timeout
  herader: {"hdr1":["val1"]}, //Object containing array of strings to be set as the request header.
  cookies: [{}], //Array of cookie information
  contentType: "json", //A shortcut to set the request "Content-Type". Possible values: "json"
  Accept:"json" //A short cut to set the accept header. Possible values: "json","bin","text", default is json
}
```


If all is ok you get respons object with the following fields:
``` javascript
{
  "status": 200, // Http status code
  "rawBody": [64,13...], //If respond had a body. Than this is its raw representation as byte array
  "body" : any, //The parsed body
  "header": {"hdr1":"val1"}, //An object with field and value of the headers.
  "cookies": []{"Name": "value"} //cookie information
}
```

When aresponse had a body, Banai will try to parse the body. First as a string, then as a JSON. If its a json than body is the object of the json (or array). If it could not parse the respond as a json than body is the string, returned from the server. If the body of the respond was a byte array than body will hold a byte array (same as the rawBody)

These are the supported REST calls by Banai:

### httpGet 
Make a get request. No body is passed

#### Synopsis
httpGet(urlPath,opt)

---

### httpPost
make a post request. Passing the body as string or array of bytes
#### Synopsis

---

### httpPut
make a put request. Passing the body as string or array of bytes
#### Synopsis
httpPut(urlPath,body,opt)

---

### httpPatch
make a patch request. Passing the body as string or array of bytes
#### Synopsis
httpPatch(urlPath,body,opt)

---


### httpDelete
make a delete request. Passing the body as string or array of bytes
#### Synopsis
httpDelete(urlPath,body,opt)

I had decided to allow body to delete request, because the standart is not clear about this.

---

### httpOptions

#### Synopsis
httpOptions(urlPath,opt)

---

### httpHead
make a head request.
#### Synopsis
httpHead(urlPath,opt)

# Secrets configuration

You can load secrets into Banai. If you have a secret set you can refer to it by its id. The relevant command will use that secret to call their function. For example. you can set a user/password secret and when calling rsh pass the secret id. Banai will initiatl ssh connection using the information in the secret.

Banai has several types of secrets:

- Text - A simple text.
- SSH - An ssh information including: user name, private key content and passphrase if any exists.
- User/Pass - The classic username password pairs

A secret configuration file has the following format:
``` javascript
{
  "secrets":[
    {
      "id" : "a secret is",
      "type" : "type of secert. one of: text,ssh,userpass",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id" : "Another secret",
      "type" : "type of secert. one of: text,ssh,userpass",
      ...
    }
  ]

}

```

## Text secret config object:
```javascript
{
  "id": "some id",
  "type": "text",
  "text": "a secret text"
}
```

## ssh secret config object:
```javascript
{
